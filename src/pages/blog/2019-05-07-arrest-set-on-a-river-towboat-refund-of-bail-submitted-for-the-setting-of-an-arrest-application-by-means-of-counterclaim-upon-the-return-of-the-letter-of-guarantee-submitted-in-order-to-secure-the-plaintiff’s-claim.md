The plaintiff vested the Court with the application for the refund of the bail submitted for the

setting of an arrest on a river towboat. The defendant filed objection seeking the dismissal of

the application as unfounded on the ground that, although the decision of the court of first instance

was enforced, the plaintiff unreasonably refused to return the letter of guarantee of the insurers,

causing administration costs and expenses to be recovered by the defendant after obtaining a writ

of execution. By way of counterclaim, the defendant requested the obligation of the plaintiff to

return the letter of guarantee submitted.



 



Constanta Court (Civil Decision no. 396/MF/2001 – unpublished) found, according to the filed documents,

that the substantive dispute between the parties was settled by the competent Court, the defendant

having fulfilled its obligation ordered by decision. As such, the Court reasoned that the retention

by the creditor-plaintiff of the letter of guarantee submitted by the defendant’s insurers after

obtaining the writ of execution has no basis as long as it was executed, reason for which the plaintiff

will be obligated to return the said letter of guarantee.



 



In our opinion the motivation of the Court is correct, given that indeed retaining a letter of

guarantee submitted in order to secure a claim after the voluntary execution of that claim appears

as unsupported and, in relation to the specific circumstances of the case, may even be considered

as abusive.



 



Also, the Court legally and righteously ruled the refund of the bail submitted for the purpose of

setting the arrest, considering that, in relation to the purpose and legal nature of the bail, keeping

it available for the Court was no longer justified as long as the substantive dispute was settled by

a final decision which was also executed.
